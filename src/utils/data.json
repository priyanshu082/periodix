        "history": "The name derives from the Greek helios for sun. The element was discovered by spectroscopy during a solar eclipse in the sun's chromosphere by the French astronomer Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen in 1868. It was independently discovered and named helium by the English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer.<br/>Helium was thought to be only a solar constituent until it was later found to be identical to the helium in the uranium ore cleveite by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay in 1895. The Swedish chemists Per Theodore Cleve and Nils Abraham Langet independently found helium in cleveite at about the same time.<br/>Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, a French astronomer, noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This element was named helium by Lockyer.The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.<br/>Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust."

The element was first separated in 1828 by the French chemist Antoine-Alexandre-Brutus Bussy and independently by the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler. Because the salts of beryllium have a sweet taste, the element was also known as glucinium from the Greek glykys for sweet, until IUPAC selected the name beryllium in 1949.<br/>Although emeralds and beryl were known to ancient civilizations, they were first recognized as the same mineral (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) by Abbé Haüy in 1798. Later that year, Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin, a French chemist, discovered that an element was present in emeralds and beryl. Attempts to isolate the new element finally succeeded in 1828 when two chemists, Friedrich Wölhler of Germany and A. Bussy of France, independently produced beryllium by reducing beryllium chloride (BeCl2) with potassium in a platinum crucible. Today, beryllium is primarily obtained from the minerals beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) and bertrandite (4BeO·2SiO2·H2O) through a chemical process or through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten beryllium chloride (BeCl2) and sodium chloride (NaCl)."

In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston claimed that columbium and tantalum were identical.Forty years later, the German chemist and pharmacist, Heinrich Rose, determined that they were two different elements in 1846 and gave the name niobium because it was so difficult to distinguish it from tantalum. The name columbium continued to be used in America and niobium in Europe until IUPAC adopted the name niobium in 1949. Niobium was first isolated by the chemist C. W. Blomstrand in 1846."

Molybdenum-98 becomes molybdenum-99 when it captures a neutron. Molybdenum-99, with a half-life of 65.94 hours, decays into technetium-99 through beta decay. While technetium has never been found to occur naturally on earth, its spectral lines have been observed in S-, M- and N-type stars.Technetium's most stable isotope, technetium-98, has a half-life of about 4,200,000 years.

Several groups claimed to have produced the element, but they could not confirm their discoveries because of the difficulty of separating promethium from other elements. Proof of the existence of promethium was obtained by Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell in 1944. Too busy with defense related research in World War II, they did not claim their discovery until 1946. They discovered promethium while analyzing the byproducts of uranium fission that were produced in a nuclear reactor located at Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Today, Clinton Laboratories is known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Today, promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission. It can also be produced by bombarding neodymium-146 with neutrons. Neodymium-146 becomes neodymium-147 when it captures a neutron. Neodymium-147, with a half-life of 11 days, decays into promethium-147 through beta decay. Promethium does not occur naturally on earth, although it has been detected in the spectrum of a star in the constellation Andromeda. Promethium's most stable isotope, promethium-145, has a half-life of 17.7 years. It decays into neodymium-145 through electron capture."

In 1881, Delafontaine determined that his decipium could be resolved into two elements, one of which was identical to Boisbaudran's samarium. In 1901, the French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay showed that this samarium earth also contained europium."

He called one yttrium, a rose-colored salt he called terbium, and a deep-yellow peroxide he called erbium. In 1862, the Swiss chemist Marc Delafontaine reexamined yttrium and found the yellow peroxide. Because the name erbium had now been assigned to the rose-colored oxide, he reintroduced the name terbium for the yellow peroxide. Thus the original names given to erbium and terbium samples are now switched"

She obtained polonium from pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive than the uranium that was separated from it. She reasoned that pitchblende must contain at least one other radioactive element. Curie needed to refine several tons of pitchblende in order to obtain tiny amounts of polonium and radium, another radioactive element discovered by Curie. One ton of uranium ore contains only about 100 micrograms (0.0001 grams) of polonium.Due to its scarcity, polonium is usually produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This forms bismuth-210, which has a half-life of 5 days. Bismuth-210 decays into polonium-210 through beta decay. Milligram amounts of polonium-210 have been produced by this method.<br/>Polonium-210 is a very strong emitter of alpha particles. A single gram of polonium-210 creates 140 Watts of heat energy and is being considered as a lightweight heat source for thermoelectric power for spacecraft. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138.39 days.<br/>Polonium's most stable isotope, polonium-209, has a half-life of 102 years. It decays into lead-205 through alpha decay. Polonium-209 is available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the cost of about $3200 per microcurie."

The plutonium-240 changed into plutonium-241, which then decayed into americium-241 through beta decay. This work was carried out at the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, now known as Argonne National Laboratory.Americium's most stable isotope, americium-243, has a half-life of about 7,370 years.

The isotope they created had a half-life of 10 minutes. In 1958, another group of scientists, Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Torbørn Sikkeland and John R. Walton, working at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, attempted to confirm the Nobel Institute's discovery. They were unable to produce any isotope of nobelium with a half-life of 10 minutes, but were able to produce nobelium-254, with a half-life of three seconds, by bombarding curium-246 with carbon-12. A third group, working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, also could not duplicate the Nobel Institute's work but were able to confirm the Berkeley group's work. Credit for discovering nobelium was eventually given to the scientists working at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, who decided to keep the name nobelium. Today, the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory is known as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.Nobelium's most stable isotope, nobelium-259, has a half-life of about 58 minutes.

In 1970, a group of scientists working at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, now known as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in Berkeley, California, bombarded atoms of californium-249 with ions of nitrogen-15, forming atoms of dubnium-260 and 4 free neutrons. Credit for the discovery of dubnium is still under debate.Dubnium's most stable isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of about 32 hours and decays through spontaneous fission."

They created seaborgium by bombarding atoms of californium-249 with ions of oxygen-18 using a machine called the Super-Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator. The collision produced atoms of seaborgium-263 and four free neutrons. Seaborgium-263 is an isotope of seaborgium with a half-life of about 1 second. Three months before the Berkeley group announced their discovery, a team of scientists working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, claimed to have produced seaborgium. Their method involved bombarding atoms of lead-207 and lead-208 with ions of chromium-54 with a device called a cyclotron. They believed that they had produced atoms of seaborgium-259. The Berkeley group's work was confirmed in 1993 and they were credited with the discovery.Seaborgium's most stable isotope, seaborgium-271, has a half-life of about 2.4 minutes. It decays into rutherfordium-267 through alpha decay or decays through spontaneous fission."
